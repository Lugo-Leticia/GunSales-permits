# GunSales-permits

Introduction
The purpose of this project is to analyze U.S. gun sales/permits against census data. Two data sets were used:

The data comes from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The NICS is used by to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. Gun shops call into this system to ensure that each customer does not have a criminal record or isnâ€™t otherwise ineligible to make a purchase.

The second data set is from the U.S. census data which contains several variables at the state level. Most variables just have one data point per state (From 2010 - 2016), but a few have data for more than one year.

Questions to address:
1.- What is the state associated with more handguns?
2.- Which states have had the higest number of gun permits and permit checks?
3.- What is the overall trend of gun purchases?
