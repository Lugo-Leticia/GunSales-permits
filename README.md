Gun-permits

Introduction
This project aims to analyze U.S. gun sales/permits against census data. Two data sets were used:

The data comes from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The NICS is used to determine whether a prospective buyer can buy firearms or explosives. Gun shops call into this system to ensure that each customer does not have a criminal record or is not otherwise ineligible to make a purchase.

The second data set is from the U.S. Census data, which contains several variables at the state level. Most variables have one data point per state (From 2010 - 2016), but a few have data for more than one year.

Questions to address:
1.- What is the state associated with more handguns?
2.- Which states have had the highest number of gun permits and permit checks?
3.- What is the overall trend of gun purchases?
